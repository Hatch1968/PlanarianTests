# PlanarianTests
A set of Playwright Testcases for the Planarian App

Clone the project and run "npm init playwright@latest"

You will need to add a file called "credentials.json" to the project that has a format like this:

{
  "username": "example@example.com",
  "password": "moust@che"
}

This is your test user.

**Note: The Planarian website cannot currently handle much load, so it is recommended to only run 1 worker at a time.**
